1. Create map with walls
2. Add eggs and holes in the map
3. First map validation( at most one wall next around egg and at least one empty place around hole)
   (Return to step 1 if not validate)
4. Arrange the coordinates of the eggs in terms of distance from left bottom corner
5. Get the closest hole from the closest egg
6. Find the shortest distance from egg to hole with restriction(forward movement valid only when the other direction of forward is not wall)
   (Return to step 1 if not validate)
7. Create the movement of mouse in terms of the route of the egg(movement from mouse position to first egg + subsequential movement pushing the egg to the hole)
   (Push motion of egg to be created by the back grid of the forward motion and the subsequential motion when encountering direction change)
8. Repeat step 5 to 7 for the remaining eggs 
9. Upon completion a full coordinate array of the motion of the mouse will be achieved and ready for visualization
